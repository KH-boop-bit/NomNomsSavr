this is the main project it is called backend. 

    backend is kinda the main base but we write the functionality in other apps

    the django app for now we called it api, most of the functionality is there
    can create other apps, but there isnt much else to note for now

    for settings:
    mostly stuff explained in the word file for why we need each of the imports already

    Actually most of the backend paths dont really matter except the API we will use as the destination for the frontend to get 
    data from.

    api -> urls.py is where the destination api urls are that the frontend needs to comms w the backend
    backend -> urls.py probably dont really need to worry bout that. just for our own usage.

    Explained cors headers and rest framework in word doc.
    jwt tokens basically acts as permission/auth everytime we access website. Everytime we make request to backend
    they need to have some id. This is basically the token. token will be used with future requests.
